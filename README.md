# Eterna Bot Docs

Welcome to the docs for the Eterna-Bot from the Eternaments server! Take a look around by using the chapter view icon in the top left of the README preview. 

## Basic Commands

`/calendar`: Displays the currently set calendar for the year. Outlines tournament kickoffs, finals, and so forth.

`/staff`: Shows the staff page for all of us who work at Eternaments. Use this if you're looking for someone specific from a certain department!

`/showteam [teamname: ]`: Fill in the `teamname` attribute with the team page that you'd like to display, such as ("Tech and Design").

## Form-Required commands

`/createplayerprofile`: You must fill out the following form to create a profile. Don't worry, this won't be permanent! You can change this at any time.
